# Aye Chef - AI Meal Planning System

AI-powered weekly meal planning with vector search, automatic shopping lists, and smart recipe imports.

**Stack:** Flask + Huey (web panel) • OpenRouter (LLM) • Qwen3-Embedding-8B (local or OpenRouter embeddings) • Mealie (recipe storage)

---

## What This Does

A complete AI meal planning system that:

1. **Plans weekly meals** using an agentic AI chef that considers variety, complexity, and protein balance
2. **Personalizes for your household** - dietary restrictions, cooking constraints, and per-session special instructions
3. **Generates shopping lists** automatically from meal plans with LLM-powered refinement
4. **Imports recipes** from supported websites with full processing (parsing, tagging, indexing)
5. **Generates shareable summaries** — copy-paste-ready meal plans and shopping lists with prep warnings and organized categories
6. **Uses vector search** for semantic recipe matching (finds recipes by meaning, not just keywords)
7. **Tracks your collection** with insights showing cuisine distribution, exploration coverage, and cooking patterns

### Limitations

- **English only.** Recipe importing, ingredient parsing, tagging, search, and meal planning all assume English-language content. Non-English recipes may fail to parse correctly, receive incorrect tags, or be removed during quality checks. Multilingual support is not currently planned.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Aye Chef, you need:

### 1. A running Mealie instance

Aye Chef is a companion tool for [Mealie](https://mealie.io), an open-source recipe manager. Mealie stores your recipes; Aye Chef adds AI meal planning on top.

If you don't have Mealie yet, set it up first: [Mealie Installation Guide](https://docs.mealie.io/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

### 2. Hardware requirements

Aye Chef uses an embedding model (`Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`, 8B parameters) for semantic recipe search. It can run locally via sentence-transformers or through the OpenRouter API. When running locally, the model loads in bfloat16 and requires significant memory:

| Platform | Minimum RAM | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4) | 32GB unified memory | 16GB is too tight with OS overhead |
| **NVIDIA GPU** | 16GB VRAM | RTX 4080, A5000, A100, etc. |
| **CPU-only** | 24GB system RAM | Works but embedding generation is slow |

The model downloads ~16GB on first use and stays cached in a Docker volume.

> **Why such a large model?** Smaller embedding models were tested but couldn't perform the semantic search tasks required by the AI meal planner (e.g., finding recipes by cooking style, protein type, or complexity). The Qwen3-Embedding-8B model's 4096-dimensional embeddings provide the retrieval quality the agentic planner depends on. If you don't have the hardware, use `embedding_provider: "openrouter"` to run embeddings via the API instead.

### 3. Docker & Docker Compose

Aye Chef runs as two Docker containers (web panel + background worker).

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose V2 is included with modern Docker Desktop

### 4. An OpenRouter API key

Aye Chef uses [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) to access LLMs (GPT-4o-mini by default) for meal planning, recipe tagging, ingredient parsing, and shopping list generation.

1. Create an account at https://openrouter.ai
2. Add credits (meal planning typically costs $0.01-0.05 per plan)
3. Generate an API key at https://openrouter.ai/keys

### 5. A Mealie API token

This lets Aye Chef read and write recipes in your Mealie instance.

1. Log into your Mealie server
2. Go to **User Settings** (click your profile icon → Settings)
3. Scroll to **API Tokens**
4. Create a new token and copy it

### 6. (Optional) Brave Search API key

Only needed if you want automatic image backfill for recipes that don't have photos. Get one at https://brave.com/search/api/ — the free tier is sufficient.

---

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepseekcoder2/ayechef.git
cd ayechef
```

### Step 2: Start the containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The first build takes several minutes — it builds the Docker image and installs Python dependencies.

> **Note:** The embedding model (~16GB) downloads on first use, not during build. This happens automatically when you first import recipes or run maintenance tools. The download is cached in a Docker volume so it only happens once.

### Step 3: Open the web panel

Go to **http://localhost:8080**

You'll see a **"Setup required"** banner at the top. This is expected.

### Step 4: Configure your Mealie connection

1. Click the **"Setup required"** banner — it takes you to the Status page
2. Click **"Go to Settings"** to jump to the Settings section on the dashboard
3. Under **Connection**, enter your Mealie server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:9000`)
4. Click **Save**

### Step 5: Add your API credentials

Still in the Settings section:

1. Expand **API Credentials**
2. Enter your **Mealie API Token** (from Prerequisites step 5)
3. Enter your **OpenRouter API Key** (from Prerequisites step 4)
4. Click **Save**

> You can verify the connection using the **"Test Connection"** button. It will confirm whether Aye Chef can reach your Mealie server with the provided token.

### Step 6: Check system status

Go to **Status** (via the nav bar or the banner link) and confirm all checks are green:

| Check | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| Config file | `data/config.yaml` exists and is readable |
| Mealie connection | Can reach your Mealie server with the token |
| OpenRouter API | API key is valid |
| Recipe index | Local search database is built (empty is OK for now) |
| Embedding model | Model is downloaded and loadable |

The recipe index and embedding model checks will resolve after you import recipes (next step).

### Step 7: Import your first recipes

Aye Chef needs recipes in your Mealie instance to plan meals from. If you already have recipes in Mealie, skip to Step 8.

**Option A: Import from a recipe website**
1. Go to **Import** in the nav bar
2. Enter a URL from a supported recipe site
3. Click **Import** — this scrapes, parses, tags, and indexes the recipe

**Option B: Bulk import from a site**
1. Go to **Import → Bulk Import**
2. Enter a recipe website URL
3. Select how many recipes to import
4. The system discovers recipe URLs and imports them in the background

**Option C: Teach Aye Chef a new site**
1. Go to **Import → Learn New Site**
2. Enter any recipe website URL
3. The LLM analyzes the site structure and generates a custom scraper

### Step 8: Build the search index

After importing recipes, build the vector search index:

1. On the **Dashboard**, scroll to **Maintenance**
2. Click **Repair & Optimize** under "Routine"
3. This tags untagged recipes, parses ingredients, and builds the search index

The first run may take a few minutes if you imported many recipes. The embedding model downloads automatically if not already cached (~16GB, one-time).

### Step 9: Plan your first meal

1. On the **Dashboard**, click **Plan Week**
2. Optionally add special instructions (e.g., "Use up leftover chicken", "No fish this week")
3. Click **Generate** — the AI plans your week and produces a shopping list
4. View the result in **Jobs** once it completes

## Important: How Aye Chef Works with Mealie

Aye Chef maintains its own search index of your recipes. Understanding this will save you confusion:

**Always import recipes through Aye Chef, not Mealie.** Aye Chef's import pipeline does much more than just adding a recipe — it scrapes the page, parses ingredients into structured data, assigns cuisine/protein/method tags, and indexes the recipe for vector search. Recipes added directly through Mealie's UI skip all of this, so the AI meal planner won't know they exist.

**If you already have recipes in Mealie** (or add some directly later), run **Repair & Optimize** from the Dashboard → Maintenance section. This syncs your Mealie library into Aye Chef's index by tagging, parsing, and indexing any recipes it doesn't know about yet.

**After any bulk changes in Mealie** — manual adds, edits, deletes — run Repair & Optimize again to keep the search index in sync.

**Meal plans draw from your indexed recipes only.** If the AI seems to have a limited pool to pick from, go to **Status** and check the recipe index count. That number is how many recipes the planner can actually see. If it's lower than your Mealie total, run Repair & Optimize.

---

## Configuration

All configuration happens through the web UI. The underlying files are:

### data/config.yaml

Created automatically on first boot from `config.yaml.example`. You can edit it through the web UI (Settings panel) or directly.

```yaml
connection:
  mealie_url: "http://your-mealie-server:9000"

mealie:
  use_direct_db: false  # Enable DB mode for faster reads (requires volume mount) WARNING: Experimental

household:
  servings: 4
  meal_types: [lunch, dinner]
  description: ""  # Who you're cooking for (e.g., "Family of 4")

preferences:
  cuisines: []              # Favorite cuisines (empty = AI varies)
  dietary_restrictions: []  # Hard restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free)

# AI context (optional) - natural language guidance for the AI
personal:
  dietary: []   # Dietary notes, one per line (e.g., "Kids are picky eaters")
  cooking: ""   # Kitchen constraints (e.g., "30 min weeknights")

pantry:
  staples:
    - salt
    - pepper
    - olive oil
    # Items you always have (excluded from shopping lists)

llm:
  chat_model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
  embedding_provider: "openrouter"  # or "local" for GPU users
  embedding_model: "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B"
  openrouter_embedding_model: "qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b"

# Optional: Image search for recipes without photos
image_search:
  use_vision_validation: true  # AI verifies images are food (slower but accurate)
```

See `config.yaml.example` for the full reference with all options documented.

### API Tokens

Configure via the web UI: **Settings → API Credentials**

| Token | Required | Where to Get |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Mealie Token | Yes | Mealie → User Settings → API Tokens |
| OpenRouter API Key | Yes | https://openrouter.ai/keys |
| Brave Search API Key | No | https://brave.com/search/api/ (for image backfill) |

Credentials are stored in `data/secrets.yaml`. Environment variables (`MEALIE_TOKEN`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `BRAVE_API_KEY`) take priority if set.

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Web Panel** (`panel/`) | Flask UI for all operations |
| **Tool Registry** (`panel/tools/registry.py`) | Maps UI actions to CLI commands |
| **Job System** (`panel/jobs/`) | Huey task queue for background execution |
| **CLI Backend** | Python scripts that implement all logic |
| **Recipe URLs** (`recipe_urls/`) | URL discovery library with auto-discovery |

### MealieClient

`MealieClient` (in `mealie_client.py`) is the unified client for all Mealie API operations. It supports two data access modes:

| Mode | Description | Performance |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **API Mode** (default) | All reads/writes go through Mealie's REST API | Standard |
| **DB Mode** (experimental) | Reads directly from Mealie's SQLite database | ~500x faster reads |

**How it works:**
- **Reads**: In DB mode, recipe data is read directly from Mealie's SQLite database at `/mealie-data/mealie.db`
- **Writes**: Always go through the API (Mealie must handle its own schema and side effects)

**When to use DB mode:**
- You have Mealie's data directory mounted as a Docker volume
- You're doing bulk operations (imports, maintenance, indexing)
- You want faster response times for read-heavy workloads

**Enabling DB mode:**

DB mode requires mounting Mealie's data volume into the Aye Chef containers. A separate compose file is provided for this:

```bash
# 1. Find your Mealie data volume
docker volume ls | grep mealie

# 2. Create .env with your volume name
echo "MEALIE_VOLUME_NAME=your_mealie_volume_name" > .env

# 3. Enable in data/config.yaml (or via Settings → Advanced in the web UI)
#    mealie:
#      use_direct_db: true

# 4. Start with both compose files
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dbmode.yml up -d
```

## Registered Tools

The panel executes these CLI tools via background jobs:

### Planning
| Tool | CLI Command | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `plan_week` | `python orchestrator.py` | Generate personalized meal plan and shopping list (supports `--temp-prompt` for one-shot instructions) |

### Import
| Tool | CLI Command | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `import_recipe` | `python import_recipe.py` | Import single recipe |
| `import_site` | `python import_site.py --yes` | Import from website |
| `add_site` | `python add_site.py --yes` | Learn new site |
| `test_import` | `python test_import.py` | Test import |

### Maintenance

Tools are organized into groups for easier navigation:

**Routine** (safe to run regularly)
| Tool | CLI Command | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `repair_optimize` | `python utils/recipe_maintenance.py` | After importing recipes, or if search seems off |
| `health_check` | `python utils/recipe_maintenance.py --quick` | To diagnose issues before taking action |
| `backfill_images` | `python recipe_images.py --backfill` | After imports or for AI-generated recipes |

**Cleanup** (deletes data ⚠️)
| Tool | CLI Command | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `cleanup_recipes` | `python utils/cleanup_duplicates.py --all --confirm` | After bulk imports that created duplicates |
| `cleanup_meals` | `python utils/cleanup_meal_data.py --confirm` | To start fresh with meal planning |

**Advanced** (recovery and debugging)
| Tool | CLI Command | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `rebuild_search` | `python utils/rebuild_search_index.py` | Only if search returns wrong results or errors |
| `clear_cache` | `python tools/invalidate_cache.py` | If suggestions seem stuck on old patterns |
| `fix_equipment` | `python utils/label_equipment.py --apply` | If shopping lists include kitchen equipment |
| `diagnose_recipe` | `python automatic_tagger.py --diagnose=<slug>` | To troubleshoot a specific recipe |

*⚠️ = Destructive operation (shows confirmation before running)*

---

### Adding Sites

No site scrapers are included by default. Use the "Learn New Site" feature to generate scrapers for any recipe website:

**Via Web UI:**
1. Go to Import → "Learn New Site"
2. Enter any recipe website URL
3. The LLM analyzes the site and generates a scraper

**Via CLI:**
```bash
python add_site.py https://example-recipe-site.com
```

Generated scrapers are saved to `recipe_urls/sites/` and auto-discovered on next use.

---

## Docker Services

### docker-compose.yml (default)

Runs the web panel and background worker. No additional configuration required.

Two services:
- **`web`** — Gunicorn serving the Flask panel on port 8080
- **`worker`** — Huey consumer (2 threads, keeps the embedding model in memory)

### docker-compose.dbmode.yml (optional)

Adds read-only access to Mealie's SQLite database for ~500x faster reads. See [Enabling DB mode](#enabling-db-mode) above.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dbmode.yml up -d
```

## Development

### Running Without Docker

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the web panel
flask --app panel.app run --port 8080

# Start the background worker (separate terminal)
huey_consumer panel.jobs.huey_config.huey -w 2 -k thread
```

On first boot, `data/config.yaml` is created automatically from `config.yaml.example`. Configure your Mealie URL and API credentials through the web UI at http://localhost:8080, or edit `data/config.yaml` and `data/secrets.yaml` directly.

### Running CLI Tools Directly

```bash
# Test configuration
python config.py

# Plan meals
python orchestrator.py --week-start 2026-02-02

# Plan meals with special instructions
python orchestrator.py --week-start 2026-02-02 --temp-prompt "Use up leftover chicken"

# Import from site
python import_site.py https://thewoksoflife.com --sitemap --dry-run

# Parse ingredients
python mealie_parse.py --scan-unparsed --yes

# Quick health check
python utils/recipe_maintenance.py --quick
```

---

## Security

Aye Chef is designed for **trusted home networks**. It has no built-in user authentication — anyone who can reach the panel can use it.

### Recommendations

- **Home network (default):** No action needed. Your router's firewall keeps the panel local.
- **Exposing beyond LAN:** Put Aye Chef behind a reverse proxy with authentication (e.g., Traefik, Caddy, Authelia, nginx proxy manager). Do **not** expose port 8080 directly to the internet.
- **API credentials** are stored in `data/secrets.yaml`. Environment variables (`MEALIE_TOKEN`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) take priority if set, if you prefer not to store credentials in a file.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](../../security/advisories/new) rather than opening a public issue.

## Troubleshooting

### "Setup required" banner won't go away

Go to **Status** and check which items are failing:
- **Config file** — Should resolve automatically. If not, verify `data/config.yaml` exists.
- **Mealie connection** — Check that `mealie_url` is correct and the Mealie server is reachable from the Aye Chef container. Use **Test Connection** in Settings.
- **OpenRouter API** — Verify your API key is valid and has credits.
- **Recipe index / Embedding model** — Run **Repair & Optimize** from Maintenance after importing recipes.

### Panel shows "Not connected"

1. Check `data/config.yaml` has correct `mealie_url`
2. Verify Mealie is running and accessible from where Aye Chef is running
3. Verify token is set via Settings → API Credentials
4. If running in Docker, use the Docker network hostname (e.g., `http://mealie:9000`) or the host IP — `localhost` inside a container refers to the container itself, not your host machine

### Jobs stuck in "pending"

1. Check worker is running: `docker compose logs worker`
2. Restart worker: `docker compose restart worker`

### Jobs hang after cancellation

If cancelling a job causes the worker to hang:
1. Use "Reset Worker" in Dashboard → Maintenance
2. Or restart: `docker compose restart worker`

### Embedding model not downloading

The local model downloads automatically on first use. If it hangs or fails, pre-download manually:
```bash
docker compose exec worker python -c \
  "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B')"
```

If you're behind a corporate proxy or firewall, ensure the container has internet access to reach Hugging Face (`huggingface.co`).

**Alternative:** If you don't want to download the model locally, set `embedding_provider: "openrouter"` in your `config.yaml` to use the OpenRouter API for embeddings instead.

### Import fails for unsupported site

Use "Learn New Site" in the panel or:
```bash
python add_site.py https://new-recipe-site.com
```

### Docker: "localhost" doesn't reach Mealie

Inside Docker, `localhost` refers to the container, not your host machine. Use one of:
- Your host's LAN IP: `http://192.168.1.x:9000`
- Docker's host gateway: `http://host.docker.internal:9000` (Docker Desktop only)
- If Mealie is also in Docker on the same network: `http://mealie:9000`
